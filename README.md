# beck-vs-the-blues
a mini corpus linguistics project
This is a repository for an assignment for a course on the methods in digital humanities at the University of Helsinki.

The task was to take some data and process it in some way to get an interesting analysis or a visualisation, and at the same time get acquainted with some useful methods.

I used, among other things, NLTK for Python and OpenRefine to get a list of the most common nouns in Beck’s lyrics and a corpus of blues lyrics, and compare the two.

A detailed account of what I did and with what is in project_description.pdf.

The piece of code I scrambled together from various different sources could be useful to somenone who wants a not-very-elegant but I guess a decent enough solution for extracting nouns from text files and outputting them as a list where each noun is on its own line.

And if you’re into word clouds or Venn diagrams there are a couple of those too!
